# MLAV.LAND website

## Intentions

The MLAV.LAND website aims at displaying our work. We intend to create a simple and lightweight interface to allow users to browse our work. Thus we have chosen to respect one main principle of screen division, with a projects table on the left, and the projects' content on the right.

One drawback is currently emerging as the list of projects is growing, with quite an excessive DOM size. The more projects, the more this one-page website is slow to load.

The website is hosted on Infomaniak's servers in Switzerland, in non-climatised datacenters.

## Stack

We aimed at creating a basic website not relying on any complex scaffold of libraries. Therefore, this website is old school coded: it is made of vanilla HTML+CSS+JS, and has no external dependency. It is uploaded on our server using the Filezilla FTP Client. Thus, some modern recommendations on web programming may not be respected.
